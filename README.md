# ChromaDB Query Result Handler
## Description
The ChromaDB Query Result Handler module (aka queryresults) is a lightweight and agnostic library designed to facilitate the handling of query results from the ChromaDB database. It allows intuitive access to embedding results, avoiding the complexity of managing multiple sublists and dictionaries.

## Features
- Simplified Access: Provides a simple interface to access query results through indexes and keys.
- Error Handling: Manages possible None values in metadata or other fields and allows for reliable calculation of the collection size.

## Installation
You can install the module using pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/FerRomMu/QueryResult.git
```

## Usage
You can see an example of usage in this [nb](example/getting_started.ipynb).

## Contribution
I created this module out of necessity. I understand that it may not be optimized as it was built to improve my personal workflow. Nevertheless, if you have any suggestions, feel free to create a PR. In my free time, I will be happy to review it.
